\# Challenge 02 – Dark Web Vendor “NightQuartz” Alias Attribution



\## Backstory

The malware vendor \*NightQuartz\* reappeared after 18 months of inactivity with a new loader. Analysts suspect the same person used a different alias two years ago on a now-defunct darknet market.



Clues exist in writing style, login-time patterns, and reused PGP fields.



\## Description

Correlate the following across the attachments:

\- stylometric similarities  

\- PGP key metadata

\- timezone correlations  



Your objective is to identify NightQuartz’s earlier alias on the marketplace \*\*CitadelBay\*\*.
